# Iris-Dataset-can-still-teach

Oftem people say that the Iris dataset is not a valid one as it is over used and anyone that read about or started learning about machine learning came accross this dataset but it still is valid to teach us valid lessons about data science.

I am reading Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka and doing a few extras by testing my visualisatin and analytical skills commenting through this Jupyter notebook in order to understand more about what I am reading and honing my skills.
